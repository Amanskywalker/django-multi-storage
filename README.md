# django-multi-storage

A Django library for the abstraction of storage and retrival of the file using django.

It's a WIP.

## motivation

There are so many storage solution like AWS S3, GCP block storage etc. All have there own complicated libraries for storeing and retreving the files. this library aims to provide a simple intergration for the storage, transformations (for images like converting it to web frendly formates, implementing CDN), and GraphQL libraries for easy access and maintance.

## current use

Currently a part of this code is used in [biztyz](biztyz.in) as I last checked.
